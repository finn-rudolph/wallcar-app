# Android App to control a wall-climbing car

This app controls a wall-climbing car built with an Arduino and some components for RC drones. Many physical parts of the system (e.g. the mount for the propeller motor) were designed from scratch in Autodesk Fusion 360 and 3D-printed. The code for the Arduino can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/finn-rudolph/wallcar-arduino).
